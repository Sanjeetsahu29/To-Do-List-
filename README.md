# To-Do-List-
A simple website made with Vanilla JavaScript where you can a create a task.

This Website made by using `HTML, CSS and JavaScript` where you can make a tasks for youself.
In this website you not only create a task but once you completed you can mark as completed and there might be possibilty that you don't want to see some of the task in the task-list then in that case I have implemented the functionality of deletion of the task.<br><br>
`LocalStorage` is used for the data storage because once you refresh the page then all the task you have created might be lost therefore using localStorage is convinient for you motive of saving our task that we created.

## Here, is the outline of the functions that you can do this Project
- You can create a task
- Mark as completed when you want or once you completed
- Delete the task that you don't want
- Tasks is stored in the localStorage of the web browser

### Here are the snapshot of the website
